# Detecting Parkinsons Disease using Biomedical voice measurements
 Using an Ensemble Learning technique, the XGBoost Classifier, I classified patients based on whether or not they had Parkinson's disease.
## Dataset:
The dataset(parkinsons.data) was got from the [UCI ML Parkinsons dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons). More details about the dataset can be found on the link.
